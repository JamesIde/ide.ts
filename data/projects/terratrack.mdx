For a long time I've wanted to build something that allows me to track my outdoor
activities - specifically my longer rucks in preparation for trips later this year.

<br />

I'd never worked with Mapbox, (specifically <a href = "https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps" target = "_#" className = "text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-900 duration-500">@rnmapbox/maps</a>) or even React Native at this point. I'd never used Expo and I didn't know what EAS and didn't know how mobile apps really worked. So it was a good opportunity to learn something new.. and man, there was a lot to learn...

<br />
Terratrack is very minimal. You select your activity type, record your activity and
save it to your device. There's an elevation chart for good measure. You can skribble
along the chart and see your marker on the selected activity, which I think is pretty
cool and useful feature.

You can also create an account (secured by <a href="https://clerk.com/" target="_#" className = "text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-900 duration-500">Clerk</a>) and upload your activites to the cloud.
These are stored on <a href = "https://supabase.com/docs" target ="_#" className = "text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-900 duration-500">Supabase</a> and secured with Supabase Auth too. Thats because theres a 
<a href = "https://terratrack-web.vercel.app/" target="_#" className = "text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-900 duration-500"> website </a> that allows you to login, and view your uploaded activities. It's a lot easier and more pleasing to view your gps tracks on a bigger screen.
<br />

One of the bigger problems I had was arround consistent location updates. Given this is a GPS tracking app, you HAVE to have the most accurate information possible, otherwise whats the point of the whole thing? This took many attempts to get right.
You can use the UserLocation Component that comes with RNMapbox and this works well on iOS devices, but on Android its a different story. Here's how I originally set it up:

<br />
```tsx
<Mapbox.MapView>
  <Camera followUserLocation={followUser} ref={cameraRef} />
  <UserLocation
    // other props
    onUpdate={(location) => {
      // update any global state, fire an api call.. anything
    }}
  />
</Mapbox.MapView>
```

<br />
This was still causing me problems. My Android would stop sending location updates
after 10-15 minutes, then receive them all in one big batch. Which wasn't helpful!
Desperate to find a solution, I spent hours testing, researching and debugging. Eventually,
I stumbled across a potential solution - battery optimization, background and expo-location.
<br />
The first one is to install expo-task-manager. This allows us to establish long running
tasks that the app must perform, even in the background. This can get quite heavy
interleaving it with the second package needed - expo-location (there is a lot of
code omitted for brevity BTW). My understanding is this... you establish a task constant
outside of your component:
<br />

```ts
// Mapbox.tsx
const TASK_FETCH_LOCATION = "TASK_FETCH_LOCATION";
// Above your component

export default function Mapbox() {
  return (
    // Your jsx
  )
}
```

<br />

Once you've done this, you need to define the task using Task Manager:

<br />

```ts
TaskManager.defineTask(TASK_FETCH_LOCATION, ({ data, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    // check `error.message` for more details.
    return;
  }

  if (recordingState.isRecording) {
    // user has clicked 'start'
    // update location, distance, elevation and so on
  }
});
```

<br />

This then runs inside of a useEffect hook:

<br />

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (recordingState.isRecording) {
    // Comes from expo-location
    Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync(TASK_FETCH_LOCATION, {
      accuracy: Location.Accuracy.Balanced,
      distanceInterval: 0,
      showsBackgroundLocationIndicator: true,
      timeInterval: 1000,
    });
  }

  // Cleanup the interval when the component unmounts
  return () => {
    Location.stopLocationUpdatesAsync(TASK_FETCH_LOCATION).catch(() => {});
  };
}, [recordingState]);
```
<br/>
You see above? There's no code thats actually updating state or making an API call with the location updates. But! We're starting a continous stream of location updates by passing in our ```TASK_FETCH_LOCATION```. This will run the task (see code snippet 2) which will handle the updating of the location object.

<br />
The catch here is the following: your Location object registers to receive the location
updates provided by the task manager - even in the background. Basically... I get
background location updates despite only having foreground permissions available.
This is a great thing for GPS tracking, but from a conceptual/technical understanding,
its a bit confusing.


<br />
Thats all to it really. A pretty minimal GPS tracker with some interesting problems
to solve and new technology to try.
